# mySensors-EthRs485Gateway-Hardware

The mySensors-EthRs485Gateway-Hardware is a mySensors compatible Ethernet / RS485 gateway that is designed to fit in a DIN rail enclosure.

The PCB dimensions are designed to fit in a [CAMDENBOSS CNMB/2/KIT DIN](http://camdenboss.com/enclosures/din-rail-enclosures/cnmb-solid-top-kit) rail enclosure - with a litte mod... ;) 

The firmware that works with this gateway can be found at https://github.com/tomarc3/mySensors-EthRs485Gateway
